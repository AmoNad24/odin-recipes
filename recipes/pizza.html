<h3>Process</h3>

<h4>Dough</h4>

<ol>
 <li>Combine ½ cup of the warm water, yeast and sugar in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes to activate or until it becomes frothy and bubbly.</li>

 <li>Pour the flour and salt into an extra-large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the liquid yeast and the remaining water. Stir with a fork until combined, then use your hands to bring the dough together in the bowl. Add a dash more water if too dry.</li>

 <li>Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead well for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>

 <li>Place dough into a large greased bowl and cover with a towel. Leave to rise in a draught-free place to double in size (approximately 1 hour). Meanwhile, make the pizza sauce.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Pizza sauce</h4>
<ol>

 <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over a medium heat and fry the garlic for 1 minute, being careful not to brown. Add remaining ingredients, cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>

 <li>Preheat oven to 210C.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Pizza</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Turn the dough onto a floured surface and cut into thirds. Onto well-greased oven trays, gently stretch out the pizza to fit each tray. This will create a wonderful rustic-shaped pizza.</li>

 <li>Top with the pre-made pizza sauce and your choice of toppings.</li>

 <li>Bake in oven for 15-20 minutes or until crust underneath is golden brown.</li>
</ol>
